Steps for registering an account.

1. Enter your Discord username + discriminator (like: MyDiscordAccount#1234) as your Username. 

2. Obtain a PIN:
- You must be in a Discord channel with the bot and have administrator permissions.
- Send:   ~login
- You will be given an 8 digit code by the bot. Copy that code and paste it in the "Pin" input.

3. Enter 000000 (6 zeros) as your 2FA token.

4. Click "Log In." You should see a QR code. Using a 2FA app like Google Authenticator for your phone, scan this QR code.

5. Return to the login screen and re-enter your Username.

6. For your PIN, provide your own, unique 8-digit pin (only numbers). This is basically your password.

7. Using your authenticator app, take the 6-digit 2FA token and type it in the 2FA Token input.

8. Click "Log In." You should be met with the login screen again with empty values. Resubmit the login process.

9. That's it! You should have access to the web panel. If you do not, you can try resetting your account by sending ~reset in Discord.
